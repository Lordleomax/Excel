## Covid19 Death, Cases and Recoveries Analysis



COVID-19 has had a devastating impact on the world, with countries and continents still struggling to recover. This analysis aims to explore the impact of COVID-19 across countries and continents in terms of the number of cases and deaths recorded, and the ratio of cases to deaths and cases to recoveries. This will help us gain insight into which countries and continents have been affected the most and to what extent.

### Methodology

This analysis will use Excel and Power Query for data cleaning and pivot tables for data aggregation. The data set used is from [Worldometer.com](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/) and includes the following columns:

Total cases,
New cases,
Total deaths,
New deaths,
Total recovered,
New recovered
Active cases,
Population,
Continent.

### Key Findings

Africa: Highest Death-to-Case Rate, Lowest Total Cases

Africa had the highest death-to-case rate of 2% despite recording the lowest total cases among all continents, with 12.84 million cases. This means that for every 100 COVID-19 cases in Africa, 2 people died.

Oceania: Lowest Death-to-Case Rate

Oceania recorded the lowest death-to-case rate of 0.21%, which means that for every 100 COVID-19 cases in Oceania, only 0.21 people died.

Europe: Highest Total Cases, Highest Recovery Rate

Europe had the highest total cases of all continents, with 230.65 million cases. However, it also had the highest recovery rate, with 98.47% of cases recovering. This is a testament to the robust management of COVID-19 in Europe.

Asia: Lowest Cases-to-Recovery Rate

Asia had the lowest cases-to-recovery rate of 73.17%, which means that only 73.17% of COVID-19 cases in Asia have recovered. This is the lowest recovery rate of all continents.

Irony: Europe Tops in Recovery Rate Despite Highest Cases

It is ironic that Europe, which had the highest total cases of COVID-19, also had the highest recovery rate. This shows that Europe was able to effectively manage the pandemic and help its citizens recover.

Asia: May Have Largest Number of Active Cases

Asia's low cases-to-recovery rate of 73.17% suggests that it may have the largest number of active cases of COVID-19. A further dive into active cases can confirm or refute this postulation.

### Conclusion

The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all continents differently. Africa has had the worst fatality rate, despite recording the lowest total cases. Oceania has had the lowest death-to-case rate. Europe has had the highest total cases, but also the highest recovery rate. Asia has the lowest cases-to-recovery rate, which suggests that it may have the largest number of active cases.


### Further Analysis

Further analysis can be done to explore the impact of COVID-19 on different demographic groups, such as age group, gender, and socioeconomic status. Additionally, the analysis can be used to identify best practices for COVID-19 management and prevention.
